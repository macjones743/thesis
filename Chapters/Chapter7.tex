\section{Suggestions for Other Improvements}

Further testing can be done beyond the Phase 3 weak combustion. Much of the data from this study, as related to cavity frequencies, is entirely qualitative. Much of the analysis was comparing relative strengths of waves seen in Schlieren imaging. It would be good to have more quantitative data to validate the qualitative data captured by the high speed camera. To do this, a pressure transducer can be mounted within the cavity model.  

Along with capturing quantitative data, testing true engine conditions would be the ultimate goal of these cavity tests. These engines do not have a well-mixed fuel and air mixture coming directly into the cavity itself. Incorporating jets of fuel into the system and having positive data showing enhanced mixing and combustion would show that these cavities could be used effectively in scramjet engines. Further details about both of these improvements are explained in the subsequent sections.
